\section{Performance}

The main goals of the new base was modifying the suspension to allow for higher operating speeds. The old mechanical base, Jeanni, did not have enough travel on its shocks to allow for very high speed operation. The increased travel will also make going onto and off the ramp less jarring. The robot is capable of about 1 hour of runtime running all systems.

As we are using a legacy vision and control algorithm that has been capable of avoiding obsticals and navigating switchbacks on a mechanical base of almost the same form factor, we are confident that the software will continue to perform as well as it has in the past.

Using the camera, objects come into view at a distance of 2 m. The LIDAR allows objects to be sensed reliably at up to 5 m. The robot will typically begin to take action at a distance of 1 m - 2 m.
