\subsection{TODO}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item finish parts
 \item add decoupling caps
 \item add filter for adc
 \item check schematic
 \item check fixed parts on layout
 \item calculate component values for analog isolator, adc filter, and decoupling caps
 \item final check
 \item finish documentation - add image of schematic and layout - legal check
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Board Description}

\subsection{Pinout}

\subsection{Design}

Since the sampling rate for the arduino is ? the cutoff for the sampling filter was chosen to be ?, which makes the sampling rate equal to 10(?) times the maximum frequency.

Optoisolators were used to seperate the two power sources.  Ground planes where used to reduce noise.

\textquotedblleft The input lines of the 4081A are 'modified TTL' in that a high level signal is any voltage between 3 and 12V\textquotedblright

No header for a joystick was added because there will always be a computer present.

\subsection{Parts list}
\subsubsection{Optoisolators}
\begin{description}
 \item[MOCD213-M] x 3

2 channel optocoupler with transistor output.  Any kind of optocoupler can be used for the digital signals.  The part I picked was the cheapest I could find at the time on Digikey.

 \item[HCNR200/1] x 1

Analog optocoupler for measuring battery voltages.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Headers}
\begin{description}
 \item[?] x 3

for arduino

 \item[?] x 2

for OSMC

 \item[?] x 2

for encoders

 \item[?] x 2

for current sensors

 \end{description}

\subsection{Future}
\begin{itemize}
 \item DC voltage control: using PWM to control the OSMC swtiching is not as efficient as using direct DC voltages.  This could be done by adding a lowpass filter to the PWM output or by using a DAC.
 \item Temperature sensing
 \item Regenerative Motor Braking (not this board?)
 \item integrate some this board's functionality into the OSMC
\end{itemize}
