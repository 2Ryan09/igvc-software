TODO
check schematic
calculate component values for analog isolator
add decoupling caps

Parts list
optoisolators
- MOCD213-M  x  3
	2 channel optocoupler with transistor output.  Any kind of optocoupler can be used for the digital signals.  The part I picked was the cheapest I could find.
- HCNR200/1
	Analog optocoupler for measuring battery voltages.
headers
- for arduino 
- for OSMC
- for encoders
- for current sensors

Design
- use polarized connectors

Future
- Regenerative Motor Braking (on motor controller, not this board)
