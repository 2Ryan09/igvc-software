microcontroller
 - required features
 - - 12-16 bit ADC
 - - enough processing power/ram/flash
 - - - need to figure this out
 - - open development tools
 - price
 - extra features
 - power usage
 
Filtering/Callibration
 - propagation delay / unknown sample time
 - estimate parameters online or offline?
 - - determine parameters using a scripted test
 - - Least squares, maximum likelyhood, kalman/particle filter etc.

Sensors
 - quantization error
 - contant bias
 - white noise
 - bias stabity
 - scale factor error
 - alignment error
 - nonlinearity
 - does GPS mounting direction matter
 - temperature dependence
 - humiditiy and pressure dependence(?)
 - coupled noise

Gyro/Accelerometer
 - gravity
 - Coriolis force

Compass
 - hard and soft iron compensation
 - world magnetic model 
 - changing magnetic fields from other electronics or magnetic objects

GPS
 - DGPS
 - - could get it from internet
 - other beacons (i.e. radio, cell phone, etc)

Implementaion
 - can GPS signal be corrected manually?
 - how important is teperature sensor position on board?

 - buy (sample) parts for board
 - design schematic

 - can GPS can get power from DB9?
 - does GPS mounting direction matter?
 - must level shift 2nd gryo from 3V to 5V
 - allow sensors to be turned off

Future
 - - use distributed processing so data can be interated with vision/LIDAR in slam (information filter?)
 - integrate GPS into board
 - add a barometer and other sensors
 - battery power/backup (?) (could be used to store callibration data)
