use Polarized pins
look at digital accel

	openmoko

hardware
- add voltage regulator
- - powered from multiple sources (dc jack, usb, battery)
- - USB Overcurrent Protection
- decide which way to program
- add oscillator
- add jtag header
- add connector for gps
- choose adc pins
- add reverse voltage protection
- add decoupling caps
- calculate values for mag s/r components
- add backup battery
- add leds
- software reset?
- change discrete components to packages
- - only if cheaper or more compact
- think about adding gyros
- make schematic look different than sparkfun

software
- store parameters in flash
- use rtc
- allow option to send covariance to do distributed filtering

future
- change to gps module
- make cheaper
- make more accurate
- make smaller
- make more energy efficient
- - disable things when not in use
- add other interfaces (ethernet, can, etc.)
