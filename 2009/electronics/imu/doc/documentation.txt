Part Selection Justification
Accelerometer
The cheapest. Adjustable sensitivity.
Compass
The cheapest.
Note: this output has an offset which is determined in code by comparing the normal and inverted signal (see Honeywell AN212).  It would be better to use the offset straps to feed in the opposite of the offset (requires a DAC).  The offset straps can also be used for callibration.

-40 to 125 degrees Celcius
min R @ 25C = 1.5
max R @ 25C = 3 ohms
(-40C - 25C) * (3300 ppm/C) * (3 ohms) = -0.64 ohms
min R = 1.5 - 0.64 = 0.86 ohms
(125C - 25C) * (4100 ppm/C) * (3 ohms) = 1.23 ohms
max R = 3 + 1.23 = 4.23 ohms
min current = 0.8 amps
max current = 8 amps
min voltage = (min current) * (max R) = 3.384
max voltage = (max current) * (min R) = 6.88
