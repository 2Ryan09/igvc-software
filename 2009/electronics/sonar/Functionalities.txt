Functions of SonarRanger (as of V2.13):


===Ping and Read===
-Ping Individual Sonar Device
-Read Range Data from Individual Sonar Device

-Ping All Sonar Devices (with single command) [*1]
-Read All Sonar Devices (with single command)

-Autopilot Mode (Continuous Ping All + Read All) [*1]
-Warning Mode (Continuous Ping All + Read All; Return Data iff Below Threshold)) [*1]

===Change Properties===
-Set Gain for Individual Sonar Device
-Set Maximum Range for Individual Sonar Device
-Set Warning Threshold for Individual Sonar Device [*2]
-Acitvate / Deactivate Individual Sonar Device

-Set Gain for All Sonar Devices
-Set Maximum Range for All Sonar Devices
-Set Warning Threshold for All Sonar Devices [*2]

-Set PingsPerSec
-Set Echo_Num

===Steps===
-Set Step No. for Individual Sonar Device [*3]
-Set Total Number of Step No.'s [*3]


===[*1]===
-Dependent on Step Properties of Sonar Devices
===[*2]===
-Applies to Warning Mode Only
===[*3]===
-Basic Concept
	-X amount of Step's per Loop
	-Each Individual Sonar Device Pings According to it's Step No.
	-Ex: Assume Total Number of Step No.'s EQU 2
		-First loop, On Step 0 - All Sonar Devices with Step No. of 0 will Ping.
		-First Loop, On Step 1 - All Sonar Devices with Step No. of 1 will Ping.
		-First Loop, On Step 2 - All Sonar Devices with Step No. of 2 will Ping.
		-Second Loop, On Step 0 - All Sonar Devices with Step No. of 0 will Ping.
		-Etc.
	-Allows for Customization of what Sonar Devices Ping, when each Sonar Device Pings, and in what order each one Pings
