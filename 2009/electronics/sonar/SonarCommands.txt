Quoted items (' ') are representative of character values.
Bracketed values ([x|y]) are representative of values where either x or y is used.
Values beginning with '0x' are representative of hex values.
The '+' symbol denotes concatenation between two or more values.
The 2BYTE string denotes a variable of two bytes (0-65534), where MSB is sent first.
The 1BYTE string denotes a variable of one byte (0-255).

Sonar Commands:

Name			Char		Decimal			Description:

Read All		'<'		060			-Reads first echo from all active sonar devices according to last ping.
Ping All		'>'		062			-Pings all active sonar devices in pre-programmed sequence.
Ping Indiv		'A' thru 'Z'	065 thru 090		-Pings individual sonar device, where 'A' represents the device with address 0xF0, 'B'
								represents the device aith address 0xF2, 'C' represents the device with address 0xF4,
								etc.
Read Indiv		'a' thru 'z'	097 thru 122		-Reads first echo from individaul sonar device according to last ping, where 'a' 
								represents the device with address 0xF0, 'b' represents the device with address 0xF2,
								'c' represents the device with address 0xF4, etc.
Autopilot		'^'+['0'|'1']	094+[048|049]		-Activates autopilot mode. Pings all active sonar devices in a pre-programmed sequence,
								then reads the first echo from all active sonar devices according to the last ping. 
								All of this is done in a continuous loop. The second value indicates whether autopilot
								mode is to be activated ('1') or deactivated ('0').
Set Freq		'%'+1BYTE	037+1BYTE		-Sets the step frequency of all 'auto ping' modes. This includes '>', '^', and '!'
								commands, but does not affect the 'A' thru 'Z' command. Frequency is set by the 
								additional 1BYTE variable and is in the value of Hz.
Set All Gain		'&'+1BYTE	038+1BYTE		-Sets the gain value of all active sonar devices. The Gain is set by the additional 
								1BYTE variable and can take on only the values between 1 and 31.
Set All MRange		'|'+2BYTE	124+2BYTE		-Sets the maximum range of all active sonar devices. The Max Range is set by the
								additional 2BYTE variable, which is in units of mm.
Warning	Mode		'!'+['0'|'1']	033+[048|049]		-Activates warning mode. Pings all active sonar devices in a pre-programmed sequence,
								then reads the first echo from each active sonar device according to last ping iff 
								the value is lower than the pre-set threshold value. The second value indicates whether
								warning mode is to be activated ('1') or deactivated ('0'). The threshold value can be
								set with the Set Thresh command.
Set Indiv Gain		'+'+1BYTE+1BYTE	043+1BYTE+1BYTE		-Sets the gain of an individual sonar device. The sonar device ID is specified by the
								first 1BYTE variable. The Gain value is set by the second 1BYTE variable and can take
								on only the values between 1 and 31.
Set Indiv MRange	'-'+1BYTE+2BYTE	045+1BYTE+2BYTE		-Sets the maximum range of an individual sonar device. The sonar device ID is specified
								by the first 1BYTE variable. The Max Range value is set by the next 2BYTE variable, 
								which is in units of mm.
Set All WarnThresh	'='+2BYTE	061+2BYTE		-Sets the threshold value for all active sonar devices. This threshold value is used in
								Warning Mode to determine which values should be sent to the computer. The 2BYTE value
								is used to specify the threshold value in mm.
Set Indiv WarnThresh	'_'+1BYTE+2BYTE	095+1BYTE+2BYTE		-Sets the threshold value for an individual sonar device. This threshold value is used 
								in Warning Mode to determine which values should be sent to the computer. The first 
								1BYTE value is used to specify the sonar device ID. The next 2BYTE value is used to
								specify the threshold value in mm.
Set Total Steps		'#'+1BYTE	035+1BYTE		-Sets the total number of steps per loop cycle. The 1BYTE variable sets the total
								number of steps variable.
Set Indiv Step		'$'+1BYTE+1BYTE 036+1BYTE+1BYTE		-Sets the step number for an individual sonar device. The fisrt 1BYTE value specifies
								the sonar device ID. The second 1BYTE value sets the step number. The step number 
								corresponds to the step in the loop in which the device will ping. Set the second
								BYTE1 to 255 to prevent the device from pinging during the loop.
