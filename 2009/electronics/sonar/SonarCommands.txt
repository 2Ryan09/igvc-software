Bracketed values ([x|y]) are representative of values where either x or y is used.
The '+' symbol denotes concatenation between two or more values (NOT addition).
The 2BYTE string denotes a variable of two bytes (0-65534), where MSB is sent first.
The 1BYTE string denotes a variable of one byte (0-255).

Sonar Commands:

Name			Char			Decimal			Description:

Read All		'<'			060			-Reads first echo from all active sonar devices according to last ping.
Ping All		'>'			062			-Pings all active sonar devices in sequence.
Ping Indiv		'A' thru 'Z'		065 thru 090		-Pings individual sonar device, where 'A' represents the device with address 0xF0,
									 'B' represents the device aith address 0xF2, 'C' represents the device with
									 address 0xF4, etc.
Ping Indiv		'P'+1BYTE 		080+1BYTE
Read Indiv		'R'+1BYTE		082+1BYTE
Read Indiv		'a' thru 'z'		097 thru 122		-Reads first echo from individaul sonar device according to last ping, where 'a'
									 represents the device with address 0xF0, 'b' represents the device with address
									 0xF2, 'c' represents the device with address 0xF4, etc.
Autopilot		'^'+['0'|'1']		094+[048|049]		-Activates autopilot mode. Pings all active sonar devices in a pre-programmed
									 sequence, then reads the first echo from all active sonar devices according to the
									 last ping. All of this is done in a continuous loop. The second value indicates
									 whether autopilot mode is to be activated ('1') or deactivated ('0').
Set Freq		'%'+1BYTE		037+1BYTE		-Sets the step frequency of all 'auto ping' modes. This includes '>', '^', and '!'*2
									 commands, but does not affect the 'A' thru 'Z' command. Frequency is set by the
									 additional 1BYTE variable and is in the value of Hz.
Set All Gain		'&'+1BYTE		038+1BYTE		-Sets the gain value of all active sonar devices. The Gain is set by the additional
									 1BYTE variable and can take on only the values between 1 and 31.
Set All MRange		'|'+2BYTE		124+2BYTE		-Sets the maximum range of all active sonar devices. The Max Range is set by the
									 additional 2BYTE variable, which is in units of mm.
Warning	Mode		'!'+['0'|'1']		033+[048|049]		-Activates warning mode. Pings all active sonar devices in a pre-programmed
									 sequence, then reads the first echo from each active sonar device according to
									 last ping iff the value is lower than the pre-set threshold value. The second
									 value indicates whether warning mode is to be activated ('1') or deactivated
									 ('0'). The threshold value can be set with the Set Thresh command.
Set Indiv Gain		'+'+1BYTE+1BYTE		043+1BYTE+1BYTE		-Sets the gain of an individual sonar device. The sonar device ID is specified by
									 the first 1BYTE variable. The Gain value is set by the second 1BYTE variable and
									 can take on only the values between 1 and 31.*1
Set Indiv MRange	'-'+1BYTE+2BYTE		045+1BYTE+2BYTE		-Sets the maximum range of an individual sonar device. The sonar device ID is
									 specified by the first 1BYTE variable. The Max Range value is set by the next
									 2BYTE variable, which is in units of mm.
Set All WarnThresh	'='+2BYTE		061+2BYTE		-Sets the threshold value for all active sonar devices. This threshold value is
									 used in Warning Mode to determine which values should be sent to the computer.
									 The 2BYTE value is used to specify the threshold value in mm.
Set Indiv WarnThresh	'_'+1BYTE+2BYTE		095+1BYTE+2BYTE		-Sets the threshold value for an individual sonar device. This threshold value is
									 used in Warning Mode to determine which values should be sent to the computer.
									 The first 1BYTE value is used to specify the sonar device ID. The next 2BYTE
									 value is used to specify the threshold value in mm.
Set Total Steps		'#'+1BYTE		035+1BYTE		-Sets the total number of steps per loop cycle. The 1BYTE variable sets the total
									 number of steps variable.
Set Indiv Step		'$'+1BYTE+1BYTE 	036+1BYTE+1BYTE		-Sets the step number for an individual sonar device. The fisrt 1BYTE value
									 specifies the sonar device ID. The second 1BYTE value sets the step number. The
									 step number corresponds to the step in the loop in which the device will ping.
									 Set the second BYTE1 to 255 to prevent the device from pinging during the loop.
Set Device Active 	'@'+['0'|'1']+1BYTE	064+[048|049]+1BYTE	-Sets an individual sonar device as active/deactive. The Second Value determines
									 whether the specified sonar device is active ('1') or deactive ('0'). The third
									 value specifies the id of the sonar device to be acivated. Use * (042) to target
									 all sonar devices (0-15 or E0-FF).
Set Echo Num		'~'+1BYTE		126+1BYTE		-Sets global Echo_Num to value specified by fisrt Value. See SRF08 Datasheet for
									 more on Echo's.
Get Indiv Gain		':'+'+'+1BYTE		058+043+1BYTE		-Returns the set gain value of an individual sonar device. The first 1BYTE value 
									 specifies the sonar device ID. Expect a 1BYTE value in the range of 1 to 31.*1
Get Indiv MRange	':'+'-'+1BYTE		058+045+1BYTE		-Returns the set maximum range value of an individual sonar device. The first 1BYTE 
									 value specifies the sonar device ID. Expect a 2BYTE value in units of mm.
Get Indiv WarnThresh	':'+'='+1BYTE		058+061+1BYTE		-Returns the set threshold value of an individual sonar device. The first 1BYTE
									 value specifies the sonar device ID. Expect a 2BYTE value in units of mm.
Get Indiv Active	':'+'@'+1BYTE		058+064+1BYTE		-Returns the set active/deactive status of an individual sonar device. The first
									 1BYTE value specifies the sonar device ID. Expect a 1BYTE value of 0 or 1.
Get Indiv Step		':'+'$'+1BYTE		058+036+1BYTE		-Returns the set step value of an individual sonar device. The first 1BYTE value
									 specifies the sonar device ID. Expect a 1BYTE value in the range of 0 to 15.
Get Freq		':'+'%'			058+037			-Returns the set step frequency value of the system. Expect a 1BYTE value in units 
									 of Hz. 
Get Step Total		':'+'#'			058+035			-Returns the set total step total of the system. Expect a 1Byte value.

*1 - See the SRF08 datasheet for more details on gain values.
*2 - Nominal value for this setting is 14Hz.
