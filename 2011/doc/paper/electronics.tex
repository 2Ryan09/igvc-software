\section{Electronics Design}

The electronics for Roxi can be broken into three major catagories: Senors, Power, and computers.

\subsection{Sensors}

Roxi uses vision and LIDAR as its primary sensors used for the navigation challenge and also has GPS and wheel encoders to allow for waypoint navigation.

\subsubsection{Vision}

The vision system consists of a AVT "Guppy" F-XXX camera connected via an IEEE 1394a link to the main computer. This camera is capible of XXX x XXX resolution at XX fps.

\subsubsection{LIDAR}

\subsubsection{GPS}

\subsection{Power}

\subsubsection{Main Power}

Main power for the robot comes from two sealed lead acid gell-cell batteries. These batteries are connected in series to produce a nominal 24 VDC supply for the motors and other systems. This provides approximatly XX $W \cdot hr$ of energy, XX hours of runtime of the motors, and XX hours of runtime of the electronics and motors.

The batteries are connected to a power distribution board, which allows the connection to each motor to be fused with XX Amps, allowing power to be cut in the event of a motor stall to prevent damage to the H-bridge. Power is also provided to several DC-DC boost converters, which output 5 VDC, 9 VDC, and 19.5 VDC for other electronics on the robot.

\subsubsection{H Bridge}

Each motor is connected to an OSMC H-bridge. This board is used to allow a low power signal from the microcontrollers to generate a high power PWM input to the motors. Each OSMC is capible of switching up to 50 VDC at 160A cont / 300A peak, allowing significant margin above our standard operating power of around 24 VDC / 20 A.

\subsubsection{Component Power}

Other systems are provided power through the use of DC-DC converters to produce voltages at 5 V, 9 V, and 19.5 V. This allows for the usb tethered microcontrollers, the firewire camera, and the main computer to be powered off of the main lead acid batteries. This greatly simplifies charging the robot, as only one battery system needs to be maintained.

\subsection{Computers}

\subsubsection{Main Computer}

Nearly all computation is performed on a single laptop containing a quadcore Intel Core i7 cpu, cuda enabled NVIDIA 285M gpu, and 6 GB of RAM. This computer is responsible for all vision, lidar, and GPS data processing and all path planning and control algoritms. It also forms the core of the sensor interconects, providing the firewire and USB bus the camera, GPS, and microcontrollers use.

\subsubsection{MCU}

Microcontrollers are used on Roxi as data aquisition boards to collect data from the wheel encoders, and as motor control boards to generate PWM signals to drive the H-bridges. There are 6 ATmega328p based Arduino Duemilanove boards on the robot, 4 interfacing with the wheel encoders, and 2 to drive the motors.
