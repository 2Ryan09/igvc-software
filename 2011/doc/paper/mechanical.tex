\section{Mechanical Design}

\subsection{Structure Overview}
% Talk about key constraints drving structure and layout. Front zone, middle zone, and rear zone.
This years drive base was guided by the following main goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item[Increased waterproofing performance]
\item[Reduced overall mass]
\item[Improved payload accommodation]
\item[Ability to hold a new laptop]
\item[Enhanced ride characteristics]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Drive System}
\paragraph{Layout \& Suspension}
% We have 4 wheel independent suspension. Talk abut custom modification to off the shelf dampers.

\paragraph{Motors \& Encoder Modification}
% Motor specs and part number of encoders. How we mounted encoders.

\subsection{Waterproofing}
% Discuss waterproofing method with outter panel reduced complexity.

\subsection{Electronics Accommodation}
\paragraph{Laptop}
% Talk about new laptop size and how it fits. Expasion on previous design. Ease of access, etc.

\paragraph{Camera}
% talk about camera mounting location and field of view.

\paragraph{LIDAR}
% Mention LIDAR FOV protection from rain, accessibility. How it comes off with 3 bolts, etc.

\paragraph{Interface Panel}
% Person based hight of interface panel. Not too high not to low, but not in the way of using the laptop.

\paragraph{Power Electronics}
% talk about the central zone how these are held there in a compact space efficient waterproof environment.
