This program regenerates the 'getsurf.c' and 'getsurf.o' files used
by the 'transform' module, given the size of the input images
that the 'transform' module is expected to encounter.

How to Use:
1. Modify the 'getpoints(W,H,D)' line in the 'main' function
   of 'genpoints.c' to have the correct width and height values.
2. Run 'make'.
3. Run './genpoints'.

This program was written by Paul Foster.
