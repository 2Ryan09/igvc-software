TODO: write this ...

Dependencies:
	FLENS - used for matrix operations
	FFTW - used for simualtion and analysis of noise

Desired Features:
	Display maps and paths
	 - can play, record, and replay sensor data from many sources (JAUS, file, etc.)
	 - maps and paths can be estimated with filters or opened from file
	  -- built in map editor
	 - can simulate sensor data based on a given map (allows you to edit things like noise)
	 - multiple filters can be run at once with attributes that are selected
	  -- have a bar on the side that you can create new filter profiles and edit properties
	 - can show and compare data about the performace of filters (i.e. state estimate, covarance of data, speed, etc.)
	 - can run with or without gui (writen so it is fast enough to be used in real applications)
	 - designed to be modular so it can be used with something higher level that controls what filters are being used
	  -- maybe the high-level thing can talk to it through JAUS
	 - save configuration


	Stociatistic(sp) filtering toolbox
	 - seperates class hierarcy from implementation
