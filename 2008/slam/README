This library provides an implementation of SLAM for mobile robots.

Directories:
	bin -- Used for files generated during compilation.
	candii -- This will contain everything specific to the robot.  This includes models and interfaces to the rest of the robot.
	doc -- Should contain files generated by Doxygen and any other documentation.
	filters --
	pdf --
	plot --
	simulation --
	test --

Dependencies:
	FLENS -- used for vector and matrix operations
	GNU Scientific Library (GSL) -- used for random number generation and probablity density functions
	FFTW -- used for discrete fourier transforms
	gnuplot -- used to plot data
