V_{back} = k w \\
I = \frac{1}{R} (V_{s} - V_{back}) = \frac{1}{R} (V_{s} - k w) \\
P = \tau \times w \\
P = I V_{back} D = I k w D \\
\tau = I k D \\
\tau = \frac{K}{R} \left( V_{s} - k w \right) D \\
\tau _{w} = \tau - \tau _{fr} \\
\end{gather*}

check to make sure P is the right power\\
\\
where: \\
$V_s$ is the supplied voltage \\
I is the supplied current \\
$V_{back}$ is the counter-EMF from the motor \\
P is the power supplied by the motor \\
$\tau$ is the torque of the motor \\
$\tau _{fr}$ is the torque of the friction due to the drive train \\
$ \tau _{w} $ is the torque resulting from the motor at the wheel \\
w is the angular speed of the motor \\
D is the duty cycle \\
R is the resistance of the motor \\

Note: above assumes that the power supply is a current source - i.e. when $D = 0$ and $\tau > 0$, $V_s > 0$ \\

Constants:
\begin{gather*}
\frac{RPM}{\tau} = -0.157, \frac{A}{\tau} = 0.1291 \\
\frac{A}{RPM} = -0.8223, \ \frac{V_{back}}{RPM} = 0.093976 \\
31.7142 in-lbf of friction \\
