must acount torque and force for:
motors
friction (at wheels)
drag (from grass and from air)
gravity

might do this from a different center of motion \\
change this so everything is a vector \\
\begin{gather*}
\tau _{w} - \tau _{Fr} = I_{w} \alpha _{w} \\
\tau _{robot} = I_{robot} \alpha _{robot} = \tau _{rw} + \tau _{lw} - \tau _{drag} \\
= (d_{r} F_{rFr} \sin (\theta _{r}) + (d_{r} \times \tau _{rFr-rot})) - (d_{l} F_{lFr} \sin (\theta _{l}) + (d_{l} \times \tau _{lFr-rot})) - ? \\
F_{robot} = m_{robot} a_{robot} = F_{rFr} + F_{lFr} + F_{gravity} - F_{drag} \\
\end{gather*}
where \\
$\tau _{w}$ is the torque resulting from the motor at the wheel \\
$\tau _{Fr}$ is the torque due to friction between the wheel and ground \\
$I_{w}$ is the angular momentum of the wheel \\
$\alpha _{w}$ is the angular acelleration of the wheel \\

Friction: \\
in the direction of wheel torque (must include gravity if at an angle) - level to ground \\
perp to previous \\
rotational perp to the wheel (like when you spin a coin) \\

Drag: \\
due to grass (does this affect wheel speed?) \\
due to atmosphere \\

Degrees of Freedom:
6 at center of robot
2 for each wheel (rotation + movement of suspension)
3 for the ball (ignoring the movement of the ball in its holder)
